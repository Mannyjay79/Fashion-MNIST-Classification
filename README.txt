# Fashion MNIST CNN Classification

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in Python using Keras to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies: `pip install tensorflow matplotlib numpy`
2. Run the script: `python fashion_mnist_cnn.py`

## Description

The model includes 6 layers: 3 convolutional, 2 pooling, 1 flattening, followed by dense layers. It is trained on the Fashion MNIST dataset and makes predictions on two images, which are displayed with their predicted and actual labels.
